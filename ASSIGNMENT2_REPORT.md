# Assignment 2 — Test Report

Date: 2026-01-06
Environment: GNU Octave 9.1.0 (installed at `D:/Masters/Robotics/octave/Octave-9.1.0`)

## Objective
Run `test_assignment2` and report results for the 3D Forward Kinematics assignment.

## Commands run
```powershell
# From PowerShell (session PATH temporarily extended)
octave-cli --no-gui --eval "cd('D:/Masters/Robotics/assignment2'); disp(['Octave version: ', version]); test_assignment2; exit;"
```

## Summary of results
- Octave started successfully (version 9.1.0).
- All basic tests (a,b,c) ran; plotting warnings about `fltk` were shown (recommend `qt`).
- Advanced tests completed.
- End-effector position reported by `plot_robot_flexible`: [-1.768, 1.768, 0.200].
- Final status: All tests completed successfully. Total points: 15/15.

## Issues encountered & fixes
1. `plot_robot_flexible.m` contained a variable named `axis` which shadowed the Octave `axis` function and caused a parse/runtime error. Fix applied:
   - Renamed variable `axis` → `ax` in `plot_robot_flexible.m`.
2. Graphics toolkit warning:
   - Octave warns that `fltk` is discouraged. This is a warning only; visualizations still run. For improved graphics, install/configure the `qt` toolkit in Octave.
3. Initial installer attempts encountered disk-space/elevation issues during automated install. Manual install was completed by the user at `D:/Masters/Robotics/octave/Octave-9.1.0`.

## Key outputs (selected)
- Rotation matrices and translation matrix checks: correct (printed in test)
- End-effector: `[-1.768, 1.768, 0.200]`

## Notes & Recommendations
- Running tests in `--no-gui` mode reduces memory footprint. For visual verification, run interactively with `octave-gui` or `octave --gui`.
- If animations are heavy, reduce frame counts in animation routines (variables like `n_frames`) to lower memory and CPU usage.
- Consider adding `D:/Masters/Robotics/octave/Octave-9.1.0/mingw64/bin` to system PATH if you want Octave available globally.

## Next steps performed
- Ran `test_assignment2` to completion in no-GUI mode.
- Created this report at `ASSIGNMENT2_REPORT.md`.
